# Song Selection

Example of using event-handling, if/else statements, play/pause, and referencing eternal audio (.mp3) tracks to toggle audio on and off.

## Task

1. In this ungraded lab, your goal is to read through the existing code of the App.js file, and update the second button so that it's running the `toggle2` function on a click to the seond button.
2. After adding the `toggle2` function to the JSX expression in the second button's `onClick` event-handling attribute, you should un-comment the bird2 variable on lines 9 to 11.
3. Next, you need to define the `toggle2` function: it should have the exact same functionality as the `toggle1` function, but it needs to work with the `bird2` variable (instead of the `bird1` variable as it does in the `toggle1` function).
